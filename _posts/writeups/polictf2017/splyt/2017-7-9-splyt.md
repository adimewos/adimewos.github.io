## Recon
We have 4 main files given, `Splyt/__init__.py`, `build.sh`, `challenge.json`, `splyt.py`.
The files can be found [here](https://github.com/adimewos/adimewos.github.io/tree/master/_posts/writeups/polictf2017/splyt). It is recommended to have a look at the files first before proceeding (it is not a reversing challenge so don't worry).

### __init__.py
Upon inspection, this file contains 2 main functions.

#### split(secret, N, T)
This function uses the Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme to split the given secret into N shares so that at least T shares are needed to reconstruct the secret. More specifically, each character in the secret (in this case our flag) is being splitted into N shares.

#### join(shares) 
This function reconstructs the secret from the shares generated with `split()`.

The rest are just helper functions to do some math for us.

#### pick_coefficients(threshold)
Returns a list of `threshold - 1` random numbers as the coefficients for our polynomial.

#### compute_poly(x, secret, coefficients)
Returns the result of `f(x)` where `coefficients` are the coefficients of the polynomial and `secret` is the constant term.

#### compute_lagrange_interpolating_polynomial(x, points)
Calls `lagrange_basis_polynomial()` to interpolate the points, in order to reconstruct the secret.

#### lagrange_basis_polynomial(x, points, i)
Just performing some calculations.

### splyt.py
This script can be used with either `python splyt.py split <file> <n> <threshold>`, or `python splyt.py join <shares.json>`, and calls the corresponding function in `__init__.py`.

### build.sh
In short, this bash script calls `splyt.py` with the flag and arguments `N = 20` and `T = 13`, then uses `jq` on the result to get 3 out of 20 shares, and saves them in `challenge.json`.

### challenge.json
Contains the shares generated with `build.sh`

## Shahmir Secret Sharing
The main thing here is the Shahmir Secret Sharing scheme that is being used by the script. More information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing).

If you are lazy, you can read a less detailed guide of it here.

### Aim
The main objective of this method is to divide a secret `S` into `n` shares, so that with `t` or more shares the secret can be easily reconstructed. However with less than `t` shares available, if implemented correctly, it is completely impossible to reconstruct the secret, even with unlimited computational resources.

### Implementation
Say we now want our secret to be splitted such that it needs to be reconstructed from at least `t` shares, we pick `t - 1` random numbers as coefficients for a polynomial with degree `t - 1`, `f(x)` without the constant term, and set the constant to be our secret.

Then, we just pass in `t` different values to `f(x)` to get `t` different shares. Of course we can create more than `t` shares, but only `t` values are needed to reconstruct our secret.

### Reconstruction
Reconstructing the secret is pretty easy, we just need to compute the [Lagrange basis polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial) (which basically just does some interpolation), to reconstruct the polynomial and retrieve the secret which is the constant term.

There is an example [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing#Example) on the entire process of splitting and reconstructing.

## Challenge
According to `build.sh`, we are given 3 shares while needing 13 shares to reconstruct the secret.
The astute reader may recall that it was mentioned earlier that without the required amount of shares it is impossible to reconstruct the secret.

That's true, however, only if it is implemented properly.

### Definitions
Before we move on, we need to define some mathematical terms.

The splitting is done with the mathematical function `f(x) = polynomial(x) + secret`, where `polynomial(x)` is the `t - 1`th degree polynomial without the constant term, and `secret` is the corresponding ordinal value of the character in the string.

If we have a string `x0,x1,x2...xn`, where `xi` represents the `i`th character in the string, and have `y0,y1,y2,...,yn`, where `yi` represents one of the shares for `xi`, we can say that `yn = polynomial(p) + xn`, where `p` is an arbitrary value mentioned earlier used to get one of the shares of the secret.

### Implementation flaw
If we look at the program carefully, we realise that the same random values are being used to split each of the characters in the string, which means `polynomial(x)` is always the same.

The main problem is that we can have `y0 = polynomial(p) + x0`, and `y1 = polynomial(p) + x1` with both `polynomial(p)` being the same function. You know what that means, we can just simply do `y1 - y0 = x1 - x0`, `y2 - y0 = x2 - x0`, and etc.

## Solution
Now, we don't even need 13 shares to reconstruct the secret, in fact, we just need 1.

Since the difference between each value in a share is the same as the difference between their corresponding secret, I made a list of the differences.

I also applied a modulus of 255 to the values as that was being done in `compute_poly()` and `compute_lagrange_interpolating_polynomial()`.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import json
from Splyt import Splyt

with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
	shares = json.load(f)

secret = ""
base = []
prev = shares[0]["y"][0]

secret_len = len(shares[0]["y"])
for i in range(secret_len):
	base += [shares[0]["y"][i] - prev]
```

Since I have the relative difference of every character, I can just add different offsets to them, and the flag will be one of the resulted strings.

```
for i in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
	for c in base:
		sys.stdout.write(chr((i + c) % 255))
	print("")

for i in range(ord('A'), ord('Z') + 1):
	for c in base:
		sys.stdout.write(chr((i + c) % 255))
	print("")
```

## Notes
### Bad implementation not design
Most of the crytographic methods being used out there are proven to be secure and hard to crack. However, it is due to implementation mistakes like this that allows the attacker to break the encryption.
