## Recon
We have 4 main files given, `Splyt/__init__.py`, `build.sh`, `challenge.json`, `splyt.py`.
The files can be found [here]().

### __init__.py
Upon inspection, this file contains 2 main functions.

#### split(secret, N, T)
This function uses the Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme to split the given secret into N shares so that at least T shares are needed to reconstruct the secret. More specifically, each character in the secret (in this case our flag) is being splitted into N shares.

#### join(shares) 
This function reconstructs the secret from the shares generated with `split()`.

The rest are just helper functions to do some math for us.

### splyt.py
This script can be used with either `python splyt.py split <file> <n> <threshold>`, or `python splyt.py join <shares.json>`, and calls the corresponding function in `__init__.py`.


### build.sh
In short, this bash script calls `splyt.py` with the flag and arguments `N = 20` and `T = 13`, then uses `jq` on the result to get 3 out of 20 shares, and saves them in `challenge.json`.

### challenge.json
Contains the shares generated with `build.sh`

## Shahmir Secret Sharing
The main thing here is the Shahmir Secret Sharing scheme that is being used by the script. More information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing).

If you are lazy, you can read a less detailed guide of it here.

### Aim
The main objective of this method is to divide a secret `S` into `n` shares, so that with `t` or more shares the secret can be easily reconstructed. However with less than `t` shares available, if implemented correctly, it is completely impossible to reconstruct the secret, even with unlimited computational resources.

### Implementation
Say we now want our secret to be splitted such that it needs to be reconstructed from at least `t` shares, we pick `t - 1` random numbers as coefficients for a polynomial with degree `t - 1`, `f(x)`, and set the constant term as our secret.

Then, we just pass in `t` different values to `f(x)` to get `t` different shares. Of course we can create more than `t` shares, but only `t` values are needed to reconstruct our secret.

### Reconstruction
Reconstructing the secret is pretty easy, we just need to compute the [Lagrange basis polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial) (which basically just does some interpolation), to reconstruct the polynomial and retrieve the secret which is the constant term.

There is an example [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing#Example) on the entire process of splitting and reconstructing.

## Challenge
According to `build.sh`, we are given 3 shares while needing 13 shares to reconstruct the secret.
The astute reader may recall that it was mentioned earlier that without the required amount of shares it is impossible to reconstruct the secret.

That's true, however, only if it is implemented properly.

### Implementation flaw
If we look at the program carefully, we realise that the same random values are being used to split each of the characters in the string.

As the splitting is done with the mathematical function `f(x) = polynomial(x) + secret`, we can see that `polynomial(x)` is the same every time.


## Solution
By slightly modifying `join()` in `__init__.py`, I came up with this.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import json
from Splyt import Splyt

with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
	shares = json.load(f)

secret = ""
base = []
prev = shares[0]["y"][0]

secret_len = len(shares[0]["y"])
for i in range(secret_len):
	base += [shares[0]["y"][i] - prev]

for i in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
	for c in base:
		sys.stdout.write(chr((i + c) % 255))
	print("")

for i in range(ord('A'), ord('Z') + 1):
	for c in base:
		sys.stdout.write(chr((i + c) % 255))
	print("")
```

Since I have the relative difference of every character, I can just add different offsets to them, and the flag will be one of the resulted strings.

## Notes
### Bad implementation not design
Most of the crytographic methods being used out there are proven to be secure and hard to crack. However, it is due to implementation mistakes like this that allows the attacker to break the encryption.
