Just another guy that is learning and likes to play CTFs.

## Content
### Notes
My blog contains mostly notes, which are a compilation of resources and challenges I've used for a particular topic. 

### Guides
I do not publish guides or tutorials, as I believe the ones out there explain things way better than I can.

### Writeups
I try my best to participate in most CTFs, though I am still new to this field thus not able to solve quite a lot of them. However I post writeups for every CTF challenge that I solved, and I hope that people can learn something from it.

## Contact
If for some reason you would like to contact me, you can [email](mailto:daniellim0611@gmail.com) me.

I am usually idle at the OverTheWire IRC with username dows, so if there's anything feel free to talk to me.

## Team
I am currently in the OpenToAll CTF Team. If you would like to participate in CTFs with a team, feel free to join us.
